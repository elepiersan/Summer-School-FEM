    "## The cable equation\n",
    "In this notebook, we will solve the cable equation in FEniCS. Let $\\Omega = [0, 1]$ be an electrical cable transmitting signals between 0 and 1 by conducting a current. The cable is also leaky, meaning that some current going into it doesn't reach the other end, instead escaping along the way. The cable equation then says that the electric potential $U(x)$ at a point on the cable satisfies the equation $$\\lambda^2 \\frac {\\partial^2 U} {\\partial^2 x} = \\tau \\frac {\\partial U} {\\partial t} + U$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\lambda, \\tau$ are length and time constants. We consider what happens if we fix the potential to $2$ at the left end of the cable and to $1$ at the right and of the cable and just leave it be until it settles in a steady state. In the steady state we will have $\\frac {\\partial U} {\\partial t} = 0$, so we can find the steady state by solving the equation $$\\lambda^2 \\frac {\\partial^2 U} {\\partial^2 x} - U = 0$$\n",
